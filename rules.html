        <h2>1: Don't be toxic or hateful</h2>
        <p>This is an over-decade old version of a block game; don't be a jerk here.</p><br>
        <h2>2: Don't grief or steal.</h2>
        <p>If it's not yours, don't take or modify it without permission.<br> A player is considered incactive after 30 days of not logging on, and thus any very unfinished builds of theirs may be modified or used, given that it's not being straight-up destroyed.<br> If a town has a rule that lowers this threshold, it may not be enforced retroactively.</p><br>
        <h2>3: No excessive arguing.</h2>
        <p>We try to keep this server as drama-free as possible, so don't instigate/drag on arguments or be rude. If you're told to stop an argument by staff, do so.</p><br>
        <h2>4: No hacking or using exploits.</h2>
        <p>Don't do this, it makes the server less fun and fair for everyone.</p><br>
        <h2>5: Don't spam or be intentionally annoying.</h2>
        <p>Again, we try to be drama-free and play the block game.</p><br>
        <h2>6: No NSFW.</h2>
        <p>Don't make grahpic sex jokes, distribute nsfw material, etc. Keep in mind minors play here.</p>
